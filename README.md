# 2048 Game: The Ultimate Tile Merging Challenge!

Welcome to the 2048 game, where logic meets fun! 🎮✨ This is a Python-based version of the popular puzzle game, built with Tkinter for a smooth and intuitive GUI. Get ready to test your skills and reach the coveted 2048 tile!

## 🎯 How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down`) to move the tiles.
- Tiles with the same number merge into one when they collide—double the fun with every move!
- Keep combining tiles to reach 2048! But beware, the game ends if no more moves are possible. Can you beat the game before that happens?

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x (the latest version is always a good choice!)
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
